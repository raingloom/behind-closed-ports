# Behind Closed Ports
A game about espionage, computers, and not trusting anyone.

## Setting
Reminiscent of Cold War era technology but with many modern ideas. Hardware is very limited.

TODO: explain in-universe the hardware limitations

Names don't have to be real, in fact, it might be better to make them up. It could even be set in the future, sort of futuretro.

TODO: cyberpunk? Bebop-

Hardware and software must be limited, force players to do weird things. We don't need QEMU machines, we need hyperoptimized kernels, DOS, hard choices between security and speed.

The goals are the usual. Money, power, influence, etc. The money could be a Bitcoin clone. Problem: admins must be able to add/remove money at will, to fix balance issues.

Learn from hacker CTF challenges!

Everyone must be motivated to either run services or to break into them. Bitcoin mining alone is not a complex enough and wouldn't introduce enough bugs. We need bugs because exploitation is a core gameplay element.

Hardware CAN be based on existing CPUs. Use Unicorn Engine?

Allow for configurability, provide a creative mode.

There are multiple "bases", that have servers running inside them, also some security and misc machines. Some of them are player controlled, some are NPC bases. NPC bases introduce a really interesting option: two groups trying to break into the same place at the same time. The NPC AI could then even choose to hire a third player group to take the first two out.
